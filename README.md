This data consists of Analysis of  multiple Contracts Award details  with a Procurement Agency Data

# INTRODUCTION 
The objective of this data analysis is to examine procurement trends and spending patterns in 
contract awards. 
This report presents an analysis of multiple Contracts Award details , using transaction Data 
from a Procurement agency.

# 2. Dataset Description 
Data Source 
The dataset used for this analysis contains customer transactions from September 30th 2013 to 
June 30th 2020 . The data was extracted from the company's Contract database. 

# Tools  
Microsoft  Excel was used for all Data cleaning, Analysis and Visualization. The use of Excel 
functions, such as pivot Table, formulas and charts help execute this Analysis effectively. 

# Methods 
1.  Data cleaning  
Removing Irrelevant Blanks in rows and columns inside the Data set  
Making sure the Dates are consistent in the Dates Column  
Taking out Duplicates in Data Set  
2. EDA ( Exploratory Data Analysis )  
Descriptive Statistics : Calculation metrics such as Median , Mean 

# Data Visualization 
Bar chart : Visualized the contract amount, by Commodity  
Line Graph: Tracked Contracts Awarded over specific periods 
Pie chart : For identifying Contracts with highest amounts

# Discussion 
The analysis of the contract award data reveals several key observations. A significant portion of 
the contracts is awarded to a small number of suppliers, indicating a potential lack of 
competition in procurement processes. Additionally, the uneven distribution of funds suggests a 
heavy reliance on specific funding sources, which may pose risks if those sources become 
unavailable. The trend analysis further reveals fluctuations in contract awards, particularly a 
decline in certain periods, possibly reflecting budget constraints or inefficiencies in allocation. 
Moreover, the presence of outliers in contract values—with some contracts being significantly 
high or low—raises concerns about potential irregularities or inconsistencies in pricing. Lastly, 
the disproportionate allocation across commodity categories suggests that certain sectors may 
be underfunded, impacting overall project efficiency.

# Recommendations For improving Effective Accountability On Contracts  
Based on the Analysis, the following recommendations are proposed to Enhance the 
performance and effectiveness along with accountability For the Project.

# Improve Budget Allocation Strategies – Address fluctuations in contract awards by 
implementing more consistent and transparent budgeting processes. Fluctuations in contract 
awards can lead to inefficiencies and resource misallocation. Implementing data-driven budget 
forecasting ensures accurate financial planning and minimizes funding gaps. Regular budget 
reviews and adjustments help align allocations with organizational priorities. Enhancing 
transparency in budget distribution improves accountability and reduces risks of 
mismanagement. A structured approach to budgeting supports financial stability and efficient 
contract execution.

# Conduct Regular Contract Audits – Review outliers in contract values to identify potential 
pricing inconsistencies or irregularities. Regular contract audits help identify pricing 
inconsistencies and potential irregularities in awarded contracts. Analyzing outliers in contract 
values ensures that costs remain fair, competitive, and justified. Detecting anomalies early can 
prevent overpricing, underpricing, or fraudulent activities. A structured audit process enhances 
financial accountability and procurement transparency. 

# Enhance Transparency and Monitoring – Implement stronger oversight measures to track 
contract performance and prevent inefficiencies. Enhancing transparency and monitoring 
ensures better oversight of contract performance, reducing inefficiencies and risks. 
Implementing real-time tracking systems allows for improved visibility into procurement 
processes. Regular reporting and audits help detect delays, cost overruns, or mismanagement 
early. Strengthening oversight fosters accountability and trust in contract execution.

# Optimize Procurement Efficiency – Streamline procurement processes to minimize excessive 
low-value contracts, reducing administrative overhead. Bulk purchasing and automation improve 
efficiency and cost-effectiveness. A well-optimized system ensures faster processing and better resource 
allocation. 

# Balance Funding Across Categories – Ensure equitable distribution of funds across commodity 
categories to prevent underfunding in critical areas.
